# DistractionBlocker
GUI application that disables access to selected websites and installed desktop applications. 

UPDATE 8/31/2022:
Created base functionality with application blocking and website blocking. Application blocking specifically required the implementation of multi-threading, enabled by a module from PyQt5.
User interaction is maintained through a GUI created with PyQt5, allowing users to add websites or installed applications to be blocked.
